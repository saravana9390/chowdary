Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project efficiently.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides tools for version control, collaboration, and project management.

With Git, developers can create branches to work on features independently and merge them later.

GitHub enhances Git by offering features like pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews.

Git is open-source and can be used locally, while GitHub requires an internet connection for hosting repositories.

GitHub Actions enable automation of workflows, such as testing and deployment.

Git uses commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to manage changes.

GitHub allows developers to fork repositories and contribute to open-source projects.

Both Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development.

Learning Git and GitHub is crucial for effective collaboration in coding projects.
